[SCION](https://github.com/jbeard4/SCION) is an implementation of [SCXML](http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/) in JavaScript. 

**SCION.Java** provides lightweight bindings to the SCION library for Java, via [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/). This allows SCXML to easily be used in Java development.

For a basic usage example of usage, see [TestSCXML.java](https://github.com/jbeard4/SCION-Java/blob/master/test/TestSCXML.java)
